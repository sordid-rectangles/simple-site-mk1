# Simple Site

This repo contains the source code for a simple site built to display links to articles, and to serve as a skeleton project for other simple personal site projects

### Built using sveltekit create-svelte, skeleton ui, & tailwind CSS

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
